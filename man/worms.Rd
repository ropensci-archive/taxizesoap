\title{Search World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)}
\description{
Paging in \code{worms_*} functions: Where available, you an use the \code{offset} parameter to
give the first record to return. The max records to return is 50, which you can not change.
If there are more than 50 records, you can do the same request, but set \code{offset=51},
for example.
}
\details{
WORMS has a SOAP API. We store the machine generated API specification in the package as the
object \code{worms_iface}. However, you can update the spec if you want using
\code{worms_gen_iface}, then pass the output of that fxn to the \code{iface} parameter of
\code{worms_*} functions.

The following functions are available to interact with WoRMS:

\itemize{
 \item worms_gen_iface Generate new WoRMS SOAP API interface.
 \item worms_children Get immediate children from a WoRMS ID.
 \item worms_common  Get common (vernacular) names from a WoRMS ID.
 \item worms_extid  Get external IDs from a WoRMS ID, E.g., get an NCBI identifier.
 \item worms_hierarchy  Get complete taxonomic hierarchy from a WoRMS ID.
 \item worms_name  Get scientific name from a WoRMS ID.
 \item worms_records Get WoRMS records from a WoRMS ID, an external ID, a scientific name, a
 common name, or a start- or end-date.
 \item worms_sources Get sources (references) for taxa from a WoRMS ID.
 \item worms_synonyms Get scientific name synonyms from a WoRMS ID.
}

Each WoRMS record (row in the output of most \code{worms_} functions) has the same
output columns:

\itemize{
 \item AphiaID: unique and persistent identifier within WoRMS. Primary key in the database.
 \item url: HTTP URL to the AphiaRecord
 \item scientificname: the full scientific name without authorship
 \item authority: the authorship information for the scientificname formatted according to the
 conventions of the applicable nomenclaturalCode
 \item rank: the taxonomic rank of the most specific name in the scientificname
 \item status: the status of the use of the scientificname as a label for a taxon. Requires
 taxonomic opinion to define the scope of a taxon
 \item unacceptreason: the reason why a scientificname is unaccepted
 \item valid_AphiaID: the AphiaID (for the scientificname) of the currently accepted taxon
 \item valid_name: the scientificname of the currently accepted taxon
 \item valid_authority: the authorship information for the scientificname of the currently
 accepted taxon
 \item kingdom: the full scientific name of the kingdom in which the taxon is classified
 \item phylum: the full scientific name of the phylum or division in which the taxon is classified
 \item class: the full scientific name of the class in which the taxon is classified
 \item order: the full scientific name of the order in which the taxon is classified
 \item family: the full scientific name of the family in which the taxon is classified
 \item genus: the full scientific name of the genus in which the taxon is classified
 \item citation: a bibliographic reference for the resource as a statement indicating how this
 record should be cited (attributed) when used
 \item lsid: LifeScience Identifier. Persistent GUID for an AphiaID
 \item isMarine: a boolean flag indicating whether the taxon is a marine organism, i.e. can be
 found in/above sea water. Possible values: 0/1/NULL
 \item isBrackish: a boolean flag indicating whether the taxon occurrs in brackish habitats.
 Possible values: 0/1/NULL
 \item isFreshwater: a boolean flag indicating whether the taxon occurrs in freshwater
 habitats, i.e. can be found in/above rivers or lakes. Possible values: 0/1/NULL
 \item isTerrestrial: a boolean flag indicating the taxon is a terrestial organism, i.e. occurrs
 on land as opposed to the sea. Possible values: 0/1/NULL
 \item isExtinct: a flag indicating an extinct organism. Possible values: 0/1/NUL
 \item match_type: Type of match. Possible values: exact/like/phonetic/near_1/near_2
 \item modified: The most recent date-time in GMT on which the resource was changed
