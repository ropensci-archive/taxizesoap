[![Project Status: Abandoned â€“ Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)

`taxizesoap` was an extension to [taxize](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize), but for data sources that use SOAP data transfer protocol, which is hard to support in R.

It's abandoned/archived now because SOAP services are a pain to support in R and/or the webservice for the data set is gone or a burden to work with.
